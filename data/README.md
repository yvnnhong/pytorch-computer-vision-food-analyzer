# Data Directory

This directory contains datasets and mappings required for the multi-task food classification system.

## Structure

### raw/
Original, unprocessed datasets. Download datasets here before running preprocessing scripts.

**Required datasets:**
- Food-101: Download from https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/
- Extract to: `raw/food-101/`

### processed/
Cleaned and preprocessed datasets generated by data pipeline scripts.

**Generated files:**
- Train/validation/test splits
- Resized and normalized images
- Class mapping files

## Configuration Files

- `cuisine_mappings.json`: Maps food categories to cuisine types
- `nutrition_db.json`: Nutritional information database for food items

## Setup Instructions

1. Download Food-101 dataset to `raw/food-101/`
2. Run `python src/data/preprocessing.py` to generate processed datasets
3. Verify data structure with `python src/data/dataset.py --validate`

## Data Requirements

- Total storage: ~5GB (raw) + ~2GB (processed)
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG
- Minimum image resolution: 224x224 pixels
