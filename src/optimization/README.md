# Optimization Directory

Model optimization tools for mobile deployment and production inference.

## Mobile Optimization

### model_quantization.py
Model compression techniques including INT8 quantization and pruning for reduced model size and faster inference.

### mobile_optimization.py
Mobile deployment optimization including Core ML conversion, iOS-specific optimizations, and on-device inference tuning.

## Performance Optimization

### inference_speedup.py
Real-time inference optimization including batch processing, TensorRT integration, and GPU acceleration techniques.

### memory_efficiency.py
Memory usage optimization for reduced RAM consumption during training and inference on resource-constrained devices.

## Usage

```python
from src.optimization.model_quantization import quantize_model
from src.optimization.mobile_optimization import optimize_for_mobile

# Quantize model for deployment
quantized_model = quantize_model(model, calibration_loader)

# Optimize for mobile deployment
mobile_model = optimize_for_mobile(quantized_model, target_platform='ios')
```

## Optimization Targets

- Model size reduction: 4x-8x compression
- Inference speed: <100ms on mobile devices
- Memory usage: <2GB RAM during inference
- Deployment formats: Core ML, ONNX, TensorRT
